##    Project: SDDC.Lab
##    Authors: Luis Chanu & Rutger Blom
##   Filename: utils/util_CreateSwitchConfig.yml
##
##
## This playbook utility creates the a file called "SwitchConfig.txt" in your home directory, which can then be used to create the ENTIRE VLAN range for all of the Pod possible given the Pod-XXX-Config.yml file.
##
## The command syntax to run this script is the same as is used to deploy a SDDC Lab, except you execut this script.  That command looks like this:
##
##                                                     ansible-playbook  -e "@~/Pod-XXX-Config.yml" utils/util_CreateSwitchConfig.yml
##
## The resultant configuration file is written to the users home directory, and is called "SwitchConfig.txt"
